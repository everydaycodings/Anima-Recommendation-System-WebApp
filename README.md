**Collaborative filtering systems** use the actions of users to recommend other movies. In general, they can either be user-based or item-based. Item based approach is usually preferred over **user-based approach.** User-based approach is often harder to scale because of the dynamic nature of users, whereas items usually donâ€™t change much, and item based approach often can be computed offline and served without constantly re-training.

## How to get the API key?

Actually, you don't have to get any API Key for **myanimelist.net** as it is free and even You don't have to Get an Account to use API.

## How to run the project?

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install all the libraries mentioned in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/everydaycodings/Anima-Recommendation-System-WebApp/blob/master/requirements.txt) file with the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the Data from the Given Link Below. And create a data and model folder in the project home directory.
4. Past the CSV File inside data folder and .pkl extension file to your model folder
4. Open your terminal/command prompt from your project directory and run the file `app.py` by executing the command `streamlit run app.py`.
5. You will be automatically redirected the your localhost in brower where you can see you WebApp in live.

## Source to the Pre-trained Modles and Datasets
### Sources of the datasets 
1) Original source: [Download Data](https://www.kaggle.com/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020), in This datasets there are arround 109Million records.

### Source to the Trained Model
If you don't want to download dataset and train it then i have uploaded the prebuild models, You can use that.
1) If you wat the **smaller** version of the model, THen i have trained **10million** records and uploaded it you can download it by [clicking here](https://mega.nz/file/FKoRVI6K#hbHMdIPV8keuAmb0Nhhu9tCjkgn7Q2U2zydAFD2dloY)
2) If you wat the **medium** version of the model, THen i have trained **20million** records and uploaded it you can download it by [clicking here](https://mega.nz/file/ZSwzQKLR#Aj4wP6nKXUzfeudeXfUkw3vi3thgbS9W1GbI682epNM)
3) If you wat the **large** version of the model, THen i have trained **50million** records and uploaded it you can download it by [clicking here](https://mega.nz/file/tagAgSaT#1vQ88TQDJfcIL6iZ6pwVUG3IYVMdOYQWRzSgO3utEF4)

### Note: The WebApp uses 10Million records so you can check the accuracy of 10Million records model by using the WebApp.
### Note: I couldn't train all 109Million records because of my pc limitation so I don't have a model for 109million records.
